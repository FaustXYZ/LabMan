# LabMan
Small lab management</br>
Rookie in php coding, just an experimental system for our own lab.
Not yet completely finished!(Especially the feedback of reagents apply).
Combine CSS/JS in php code, so it may seem a little messy.
Functions including: Register; Profile/Password edit; Report submission/download/score; 
Reagents apply/check/feedback; Inventory execution.
Please import TEST.sql.
Detailed readme will be caught up later.
