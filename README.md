# LabMan
Small lab management</br>
Rookie in php coding, just an experimental system for our own lab.</br>
<b>Not yet completely finished!</b>(Especially the feedback of reagents apply).</br>
Combine CSS/JS in php code, so it may seem a little messy.</br>
Functions including: <b>Register; Profile/Password edit; Report submission/download/score; </br>
Reagents apply/check/feedback; Inventory execution.</b></br>
Please import TEST.sql.</br>
Detailed readme will be caught up later.</br>
